# Data Structures

Below is an overview of some fundamental data structures and functions, explained in a simple, straightforward manner:

## 1. Lists 
  #### Think of boxes in a row.

**What They Are:**  
A list is an ordered collection of items. Think of it as a row of boxes where each box holds a value. In many programming languages (like Python), lists are dynamic, meaning you can change their size during execution.

**Key Characteristics:**  
- **Ordered:** The order of items is maintained.
- **Indexable:** You can access elements by their position (index), usually starting at 0.
- **Mutable:** Items in the list can be changed (e.g., replace, add, remove).

**Common Operations:**  
- **Access:** Retrieve an element using its index.  
  Example: `element = myList[2]`  
- **Insertion:** Add an item at the end or in between.  
  Example: `myList.append(item)` or `myList.insert(index, item)`  
- **Deletion:** Remove an item by its value or index.  
  Example: `myList.remove(item)` or `del myList[index]`  
- **Iteration:** Loop over the list to examine or modify each element.

**Graphical Representation:**  
```
Index:   0     1     2     3
         ---------------------
List:   [A] → [B] → [C] → [D]
```

## 2. Stacks
  #### Imagine a vertical pile where you add/remove items from the top.

**What They Are:**  
A stack is a collection that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. Imagine a stack of plates: you add (push) a new plate to the top, and you take (pop) the top plate off first.

**Key Characteristics:**  
- **LIFO Behavior:** The most recently added element is the first to be removed.
- **Limited Access:** You typically only interact with the top element.

**Common Operations:**  
- **Push:** Add an item to the top of the stack.  
  Example: `stack.push(item)`  
- **Pop:** Remove and return the top item from the stack.  
  Example: `item = stack.pop()`  
- **Peek:** Look at the top item without removing it.  
  Example: `topItem = stack.peek()`  
- **IsEmpty:** Check if the stack is empty.

**Graphical Representation:**  
```
   TOP
    ↓
  +-----+
  |  C  |
  +-----+
  |  B  |
  +-----+
  |  A  |
  +-----+
```

## 3. Queues
  #### Picture a line where the front comes off first.

**What They Are:**  
A queue is a collection that operates on the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. Think of waiting in line at a ticket counter: the first person in line is served first.

**Key Characteristics:**  
- **FIFO Behavior:** The element added first is removed first.
- **Two Ends:** One end is used for insertion (enqueue) and the other for removal (dequeue).

**Common Operations:**  
- **Enqueue:** Add an item to the end of the queue.  
  Example: `queue.enqueue(item)`  
- **Dequeue:** Remove and return the item at the front.  
  Example: `item = queue.dequeue()`  
- **Peek/Front:** Look at the element at the front without removing it.  
  Example: `frontItem = queue.peek()`  
- **IsEmpty:** Check if the queue is empty.

**Graphical Representation:**  
```
FRONT → [A] → [B] → [C] → [D] ← REAR
```

## 4. Trees
  #### Visualize a branching structure.

**What They Are:**  
A tree is a hierarchical data structure made up of nodes, with one node designated as the root. Each node can have child nodes, and these children can have their own children, forming a structure that resembles a tree.

**Key Characteristics:**  
- **Hierarchical Structure:** Nodes are linked in a parent-child relationship.
- **Root:** The top node of the tree.
- **Leaves:** Nodes with no children.

**Common Types:**  
- **Binary Trees:** Each node has at most two children, commonly labeled left and right.
- **Binary Search Trees (BSTs):** A special type of binary tree where, for any given node, all values in its left subtree are less than the node’s value, and all values in its right subtree are greater.

**Common Operations:**  
- **Traversal:** Visiting all the nodes in a specific order.  
  - *In-Order (Left, Node, Right)*: Often used with BSTs to retrieve items in sorted order.
  - *Pre-Order (Node, Left, Right)* and *Post-Order (Left, Right, Node)* are other traversal orders.
- **Insertion:** Add a new node to the tree.
- **Deletion:** Remove a node from the tree, which may involve rearranging other nodes.
- **Search:** Find a node with a specific value.

**Graphical Representation (Binary Tree Example):**  
```
         [Root]
        /      \
     [L]        [R]
    /   \      /    \
 [L-L] [L-R]  [R-L] [R-R]
```

## 5. Hash Functions
  #### A process turning data into an index.

**What They Are:**  
A hash function takes input (or “keys”) and returns a fixed-size string of bytes. This output, typically called a hash code, is usually a numerical value that represents the original data.

**Key Characteristics:**  
- **Deterministic:** The same input always produces the same output.
- **Efficient:** Designed to perform quickly.
- **Uniformity:** Ideally, different inputs should produce different hash codes to minimize collisions.

**Graphical Concept:**  
```
Data: "apple"  
        ↓
Hash Function (e.g., h(x))  
        ↓
   Hash Code: 1234  
```

**Use Case:**  
They are widely used in cryptography, data indexing, and for quickly comparing large amounts of data. In data structures like hash tables, hash functions are used to compute the index at which to store a key-value pair.

## 6. Maps (also known as Dictionaries or Associative Arrays)
  #### A table matching keys to values.

**What They Are:**  
A map is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. You can think of it as a real-life dictionary where you look up a word (key) to find its definition (value).

**Key Characteristics:**  
- **Key-Value Pair Storage:** Each element is accessed by a unique key rather than a numeric index.
- **Fast Lookups:** Thanks to hash functions, maps (or hash maps) can quickly find the value associated with a given key.

**Common Operations:**  
- **Insertion:** Add a key-value pair.  
  Example: `myMap["apple"] = "A fruit"`  
- **Deletion:** Remove a key-value pair by key.  
  Example: `del myMap["apple"]`  
- **Lookup:** Retrieve the value associated with a key.  
  Example: `value = myMap["apple"]`  
- **Iteration:** Loop through keys, values, or key-value pairs.

**Graphical Representation:**  
```
      +----------------------+
      |   Key    |  Value    |
      +----------------------+
      | "apple"  | "A fruit" |
      | "car"    | "A vehicle"|
      | "book"   | "A story"  |
      +----------------------+
```

### Summary

- **Lists:** Ordered, indexable collections; good for storing sequences where order matters.
- **Stacks:** LIFO structures; useful when you need to reverse the order, such as in backtracking or undo operations.
- **Queues:** FIFO structures; ideal for processes that require order preservation like scheduling tasks.
- **Trees:** Hierarchical structures; excellent for representing relationships (like family trees or file systems) or for enabling quick searches (as in binary search trees).
- **Hash Functions:** Algorithms that convert data into a fixed-size code, crucial for fast data retrieval.
- **Maps:** Collections that store data in key-value pairs; they combine hash functions with ordered lookup functionality to provide very fast access to data.

Each of these data structures has its specific use cases based on the efficiency, order, and type of operations needed. Understanding them helps you choose the right tool for managing and processing your data.
